# code-refactor

## Description:
This project modifies the HTML & CSS files for the Horiseon Webpage. These changes make the code easier to read by other developers for future maintenance and updates by consolidating code redundancies in the style.css file. It will also make the website more accessible to the public by adding semantic syntax to the index.html file where there was none previously.
